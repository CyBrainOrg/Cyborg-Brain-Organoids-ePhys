Single channel spike detection and clustering using "kmeans" on MATLAB;
The code is generating 8 figures based on the analysis performed on a filtered electrophysiological recording;
Figure 1 shows a time window with all the spikes detected and the average waveform;
Figure 2 shows the time series and the corresponding raster plot (before clustering);
Figure 3 shows the waveforms detected in the PC1 - PC2 plane, along with the projection of the scores of all eigenvectors;
Figure 4 shows the explained variance of each PC;
Figure 5 shows the waveforms detected in the PC1 - PC2 space after clustering;
Figure 6 shows, for each cluster (left column is cluster 1), from top to bottom, all the waveforms, the average waveform, and the average waveform +/- 1 S.D.;
Figure 7 shows the colored raster plot accordingly to the clustering results;
Figure 8 shows (top line) the inverted average waveform for each cluster and the local maximum and corresponding FWHM. Bottom line shows Interspike Intervals histogram for each cluster;
